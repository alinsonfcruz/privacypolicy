Privacy Policy for CITS Timeclock
Last Updated: 12/2/25

Cruz IT Services (“CITS”, “we”, “our”, or “us”) operates the CITS Timeclock mobile application (“App”). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, and protect information when employees use the App. This App is intended solely for employees whose company has provided authorized access. If your employer has not issued your login credentials, you cannot use this App.

-----------------------------------------
1. Eligibility and Access
-----------------------------------------
CITS Timeclock is an employee-only application. Access is restricted to users who have been granted credentials by their employer. The App is not available to the general public, and the data collected is managed by the employer that provided access.

-----------------------------------------
2. Information We Collect
-----------------------------------------
The App collects and processes the following types of data:

A. Shift & Work Activity Data
• Clock-in and clock-out times  
• Breaks, fuel logs, meeting activity  
• Job selection and work status  
• Employee-entered shift notes  

B. Delivery & Material Usage Data
• Delivery activity  
• Customer/job drop details  
• Material usage, amounts, and notes  

C. Photos
• Photos captured through the App  
• Used for job documentation, delivery verification, and shift reporting  

D. Location Data (If enabled by employer)
• GPS location when performing job-related tasks  
• Used for delivery verification, job tracking, and shift accuracy  
• Only collected while using the App and for employer-approved purposes  

E. Device & Technical Data
• Device model, OS version  
• Crash logs and performance data  
• Offline sync status  

-----------------------------------------
3. How We Use the Information
-----------------------------------------
Data collected through the App is used for employment-related purposes, including:

• Time tracking and payroll accuracy  
• Delivery and material usage reporting  
• Job management and operational efficiency  
• Employee workflow auditing and compliance  
• Safety, accountability, and job-site verification  
• Offline-to-online syncing to ensure data integrity  

CITS does NOT sell, rent, or commercially share your data.

-----------------------------------------
4. How Your Data Is Stored
-----------------------------------------
• Data is securely transferred to your employer’s server or CITS-managed backend.  
• Offline data is stored locally on the device until it can sync.  
• Photos and location data are stored only when required for job reporting.  
• Your employer determines how long data is retained.

-----------------------------------------
5. Who Can Access Your Data
-----------------------------------------
Access to data is strictly limited to:

• Your employer  
• Authorized administrators within your organization  
• CITS support staff only when troubleshooting authorized issues  

CITS does not grant data access to any unauthorized third parties.

-----------------------------------------
6. Data Sharing
-----------------------------------------
We do NOT share your data with advertisers or unrelated third parties.  
Data may be shared only with:

• Your employer  
• Service providers assisting in secure storage or syncing  
• Authorities, only when legally required (rare and minimal)  

-----------------------------------------
7. Data Security
-----------------------------------------
We implement industry-standard technical and organizational security measures, including:

• Encrypted data transmission  
• Secure authentication and access control  
• Offline data isolation  
• Regular security reviews  

No system is 100% secure, but strong protections are in place.

-----------------------------------------
8. User Rights
-----------------------------------------
Since the App is used in an employer-controlled environment, requests regarding:

• Access to data  
• Correction of data  
• Deletion of data  

must be directed to your employer.  
CITS will support employer-initiated requests when required.

-----------------------------------------
9. Children's Privacy
-----------------------------------------
This App is not intended for children or the general public. It is used exclusively by authorized company staff.

-----------------------------------------
10. Changes to This Policy
